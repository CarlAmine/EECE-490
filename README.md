The project is divided into different sections:
-Notebooks containing relevant EDA and code that generated our models
-streamlit to run the application
-templates containing HTML file
-.github/workflows to Dockerize

In the main branch:
-we have the two animations used in the website
-app2.py which corresponds to the back-end logic of our website importing the models
-The powerpoint presentation
-requirements.txt which contains all the requirements of the project


This project consists of two main models, one tailored to identify recipes from ingredient input and the other trained to identify recipes from simple photos.
